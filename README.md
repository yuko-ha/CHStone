# CHStone

A Suite of Benchmark Programs for C-based High-Level Synthesis

## Introduction

The CHStone benchmark suite has been developed for C-based high-level synthesis (HLS). The CHStone benchmark suite selected programs of various application domains, some of which originally belong to other benchmark suites. CHStone has several key features described as follows:

    - CHStone consists of 12 programs which are selected from various application domains such as arithmetic, media processing, security and microprocessor.
    - The programs in CHStone are relatively large compared with the ones which have been widely used in the past literature on HLS.
    - The CHStone benchmark programs are written in the standard C language, and can be compiled and executed on a host computer.
    - In our experimental environment, we used GCC 3.4.4 on Windows XP.
    - All the programs in CHStone have been confirmed to be synthesizable by a state-of-the-art HLS tool.
    - In our experimental environment, we used eXCite from YXI.
    - CHStone is very easy to use since test vectors are self-contained and no external library is necessary.
